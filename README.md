script is not maintained. I recommend you check out the following projects instead:

## [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
Bundle javascript files (basically what script did)

## [enchilada](https://github.com/shtylman/node-enchilada)
Express middleware for bundling commonjs style files automatically. Handles caching, minifcation, and multi bundles.
